# DSA Notes

## Types / Classification of DS

- Linear
  - Static
    - Array
  - Dynamic
    - Linked List
    - Stack
    - Queue
- Non Linear
  - Tree
  - Graph

## Types / Classification of Algo

- Simple recursive
- Divide & Conquer (Divide into smaller sub problems, solve problems recursively. Combine solutions of subproblem into solution of original problem). Quick, Merge Sort
- Dynamic Programming: Remembers past result
- Greedy: hope local optimum at each step, we get global optimum
- Brute Force: Tries all possibilites
- Randomised
